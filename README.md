# Prayer Timings Web Application

This project is a web application built using React that provides prayer timings for different cities. Users can select a city from a dropdown menu, and the application will display the prayer times for that city. Additionally, the app features a dynamically updating clock and a countdown timer showing the time remaining until the next prayer.

## Features

- **City Selection**: Choose a city from the dropdown menu to view its prayer timings.
- **Dynamic Clock**: The current date and time is displayed in the header, updating every second.
- **Countdown Timer**: A timer shows the remaining time until the next prayer, updated in real-time.
- **Material-UI**: The project uses Material-UI for styling and UI components.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side effects.
